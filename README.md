## ChatGPMe Client

This is a client for the ChatGPMe project. It is built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

## Getting Started

First, ensure node and pnpm are installed:

```bash
node -v  # Must be on node >= v18.0.0
npm install -g pnpm
```

Then, install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

**Important:** Set up and run graphQL server before starting the development server, as this client depends on types generated from the server.

Finally, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
